    My time im San Francisco is a different experience. I started off slow because I didn't get a chance to get enough major class. I got to be more fluently in C++ because the course help me on better design and implement data structure on a medium-size application. But on the side, I joined 42 intense program in Fremont and developed some skills on teamwork and learning C.
    On side of classes, I also did more side projects to enhance skills I have learnt before.
